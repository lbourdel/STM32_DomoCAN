N/** @brief Reset the Handle's State field.
N  * @param __HANDLE__ specifies the Peripheral Handle.
N  * @note  This macro can be used for the following purpose: 
N  *          - When the Handle is declared as local variable; before passing it as parameter
N  *            to HAL_PPP_Init() for the first time, it is mandatory to use this macro 
N  *            to set to 0 the Handle's "State" field.
N  *            Otherwise, "State" field may have any random value and the first time the function 
N  *            HAL_PPP_Init() is called, the low level hardware initialization will be missed
N  *            (i.e. HAL_PPP_MspInit() will not be executed).
N  *          - When there is a need to reconfigure the low level hardware: instead of calling
N  *            HAL_PPP_DeInit() then HAL_PPP_Init(), user can make a call to this macro then HAL_PPP_Init().
N  *            In this later function, when the Handle's "State" field is set to 0, it will execute the function
N  *            HAL_PPP_MspInit() which will reconfigure the low level hardware.
N  * @retval None
